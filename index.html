                <header>DeLorean DMC-12</header>
                In October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean DMC-12 was completed by American automotive
                chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at Pontiac.

                Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted Wankel rotary engine.
                The engine selection was reconsidered when Comotor production ended, and the favored engine
                became Ford's "Cologne V6." Eventually the French/Swedish PRV (Peugeot-Renault-Volvo)
                fuel injected V6 was selected. Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined
                location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.
                The chassis was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing
                technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while
                presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which DeLorean had
                purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.

                The engine is a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) 2.85 litre V6 which was designed and
                built under special contract with the DMC Company. These PRV engines were a
                development of the 2.7 litre V6 in the Renault 30, and were built in the PRV Factory
                in Douvrin, Northern France. The gearbox, also designed by PRV, was built at the Renault
                facility near Caen in Normandy. The engines and gearboxes were shipped weekly by sea
                from the PRV Factories to the DMC Factory in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland.

                DeLorean's comparison literature noted that the DMC-12 could achieve 0–60 miles per hour
                (0–97 km/h) in 8.8 seconds, when equipped with a manual transmission. When equipped with
                an automatic transmission, the DeLorean would accelerate from 0–60 miles per hour
                (0–97 km/h) in 10.5 seconds as tested by Road & Track magazine

                <header>Pricing</header>
                The car was named the DMC-12 because of its intended original price of US$12,000.
                New DMC-12s had a suggested retail price of $25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an
                automatic transmission); this is equivalent to approximately $64,852 in 2014.[26]
                There were extensive waiting lists of people willing to pay up to $10,000 above the
                list price; however, after the collapse of the DeLorean Motor Company, unsold cars
                could be purchased for under the retail price.[27]

                The DMC-12 was only available with two factory options including a no-cost manual
                transmission or automatic transmission and the choice of a grey or black interior.
                Several dealer options were available, including a car cover; floor mats; black textured
                accent stripes; grey scotch-cal accent stripes; a luggage rack and a ski-rack adapter.
                The standard feature list included stainless steel body panels; gull-wing doors with
                cryogenically treated torsion bars; leather seats; air conditioning; an AM/FM cassette
                stereo system; power windows, locks and mirrors; a tilt and telescopic steering wheel;
                tinted glass; body side moldings; intermittent/constant windshield wipers; and an electric
                rear window defogger.

                Several special-edition DMC-12 cars have been produced over the years, and the car is
                most notably featured as the time machine in the Back to the Future film trilogy.
                Six DeLorean chassis were used during the production, along with one manufactured out of
                fiberglass for scenes where a full-size DeLorean was needed to "fly" on-screen; only three
                of the cars still exist, with one that was destroyed at the end of Back to the Future
                Part III, two additional were abandoned, and the fiberglass replica was scrapped.
                Universal Studios owns two of the remaining cars, occasionally putting them on display
                or using them for other productions, and the last resides in a private collection after
                having been extensively restored.[44]

                A number of production DeLoreans have been modified by the aftermarket into
                Back To The Future time machine replicas whose bodies and interiors are modified
                to mirror the appearance and functions of the film cars.
