        <header>DeLorean DMC-12</header>
        <p>
            In Octo&shy;ber 1976, the first proto&shy;type DeLorean DMC-12 was comple&shy;ted
            by Ame&shy;rican auto&shy;motive
            chief engi&shy;neer William T. Collins, formerly chief engine&shy;er at Pontiac.

        </div>
        <p>
            Originally, the car was intend&shy;ed to have a central&shy;ly-mount&shy;ed
            Wankel rotary engine.
            The engine select&shy;ion was re&shy;considered when Comotor product&shy;ion
            end&shy;ed, and the fa&shy;vored engine
            be&shy;came Ford's "Cologne V6." Event&shy;ually the French/Swedish PRV (Peugeot-Renault-Volvo)
            fuel inject&shy;ed V6 was select&shy;ed. Also the engine lo&shy;cation moved
            from the mid-engin&shy;ed lo&shy;cation in the proto&shy;type to a rear-engined
            install&shy;ation in the product&shy;ion car.
            The chassis was initially plan&shy;ned to be produc&shy;ed from a new and untested manufacturing
            technology known as elastic reser&shy;voir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while
            pre&shy;sumably lowering its product&shy;ion costs. This new technology, for which DeLorean had
            purchased patent rights, was event&shy;ually found to be un&shy;suitable.

            The engine is a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) 2.85 litre V6 which was desig&shy;ned and
            built under spe&shy;cial con&shy;tract with the DMC Company. These PRV engines were a
            development of the 2.7 litre V6 in the Renault 30, and were built in the PRV Factory
            in Douvrin, Northern France. The gear&shy;box, also design&shy;ed by PRV,
            was built at the Renault
            facility near Caen in Normandy. The engines and gear&shy;boxes were shipped weekly by sea
            from the PRV Fac&shy;tories to the DMC Factory in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland.

            DeLorean's comparison li&shy;terature noted that the DMC-12 could achieve 0–60 miles per hour
            (0–97 km/h) in 8.8 seconds, when equip&shy;ped with a manual tran&shy;smission.
            When equip&shy;ped with
            an automatic transmission, the DeLorean would ac&shy;celerate from 0–60 miles per hour
            (0–97 km/h) in 10.5 seconds as test&shy;ed by Road & Track magazine

        <header>Pricing</header>
        <p>
            The car was named the DMC-12 be&shy;cause of its intend&shy;ed ori&shy;ginal price of US$12,000.
            New DMC-12s had a suggested retail price of $25,000 ($650 more when equip&shy;ped with an
            automatic transmission); this is equi&shy;valent to approximately $64,852 in 2014.[26]
            There were exten&shy;sive waiting lists of people willing to pay up to $10,000 above the
            list price; however, after the collapse of the DeLorean Motor Company, unsold cars
            could be pur&shy;chased for under the retail price.[27]
        </p>
        <p>
            The DMC-12 was only avail&shy;able with two fac&shy;tory opti&shy;ons includ&shy;ing
            a no-cost manual
            transmission or automatic transmission and the choice of a grey or black interior.
            Several dealer options were avail&shy;able, includ&shy;ing a car cover;
            floor mats; black te&shy;xtured
            accent stripes; grey scotch-cal accent stripes; a luggage rack and a ski-rack adapter.
            The stand&shy;ard feature list included stain&shy;less steel body panels; gull-wing doors with
            cryo&shy;genically treated torsion bars; leather seats; air condi&shy;tioning; an AM/FM cassette
            stereo system; power win&shy;dows, locks and mirrors; a tilt and telescopic steering wheel;
            tinted glass; body side moldings; intermit&shy;tent/constant windshield wipers; and an electric
            rear window defogger.

        <header>Back to the Future</header>
        <p>
            Several special-edition DMC-12 cars have been produc&shy;ed over the years, and the car is
            most notably featur&shy;ed as the time machine in the Back to the Future film trilogy.
            Six DeLorean chassis were used during the production, along with one manu&shy;factured out of
            fiber&shy;glass for scenes where a full-size DeLorean was needed to "fly" on-screen; only three
            of the cars still exist, with one that was destroy&shy;ed at the end of Back to the Future
            Part III, two add&shy;itional were aban&shy;doned, and the fiberglass replica was scrapped.
            Universal Studios owns two of the remaining cars, occasion&shy;ally putting them on display
            or using them for other product&shy;ions, and the last resides in a private collection after
            having been exten&shy;sively restored.[44]

            A number of product&shy;ion DeLoreans have been modified by the aftermarket into
            Back To The Future time machine replic&shy;as whose bo&shy;dies and inter&shy;iors are modified
            to mirror the appearance and func&shy;tions of the film cars.
